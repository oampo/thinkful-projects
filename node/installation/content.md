After six months of trying to convince your boss that Node.js would be a great fit for your team, your boss comes to you and says that he's heard of this great new technology: Node.js.  You smile politely and say that you'll get it installed as soon as possible.

# Milestones

## Milestone 1: Install Node

To complete this milestone you simply need to install Node.js.  We recommend using a package manager to do this.

* If you are running Windows, then [Scoop](http://scoop.sh/) is for you.
* If you are running OSX then you should use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
* If you are on running another *nix, then use whichever package manager comes with your distro.

You can also use your package manager to install the other dependencies which you may run into whilst working on the projects.

## Milestone 2: Make sure it's working

To complete this milestone you should run a couple of sanity checks to make sure that the install worked.

* From the command line, run `node --version` to check which version of Node you have installed.  We recommend a version of Node greater than 0.12.
* To enter the Node REPL, run `node`.  Try entering a couple of JavaScript commands to make sure they work how you would expect.  To exit the REPL, hit Ctrl-d.
